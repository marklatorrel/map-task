# Real time bus tracker 

## Real time bus tracker 

# Description of project
This is a first version of a bus tracking app. In this case we are tracking the buses of route 1, from MIT to Harvard. You can see each bus identified by their own ID and the position refreshes every 5 seconds. Hope you like it.

# How to run
You only need to clone the repository and run the Index.html code on any web browser.

# Roadmap of future
The next implementation would be adding a bus icon, instead of the marker. I would also add the possibility to choose among many routes.

# Usage
Just load the page, you'll start seeing the buses in real time.
